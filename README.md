## Problem Statement for Cross-Sell Prediction Problem
In this project, our client is an insurance company XYZ limited that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now, They want to build a model to predict whether the policyholders from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

Developing a model to estimate whether a customer will be interested in a vehicle insurance policy is extremely helpful for the company. This would enable the organization to plan its communication strategy so that it can reach out to these customers and optimize its business model.

The problem statement and the dataset can be accessed from the Analytics Vidhya data hack platform.

The problem definition specifies that in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, we have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

## Hypothesis Generation for Cross-Sell Prediction
Once you have understood the problem statement and gathered the required domain knowledge. The next step comes, the hypothesis generation. This will directly spring from the problem statement. Whatever set of analysis we can think of at this stage we should write it down.

The structured thinking approach will help us here. Let me state some hypotheses from our problem statement.

Male customers are more tend to buy vehicle insurance than females.
The middle-aged customers would be more interested in the insurance offer.
Customers having a driving license are more prone to convert.
Those with new vehicles would be more interested in getting insurance.
The customers who already have vehicle insurance won’t be interested in getting another.
If the Customer got his/her vehicle damaged in the past, they would be more interested in buying insurance.
The above mentioned are just a few examples of hypothesis generation. You are free to add as many you want. Once you have the hypothesis ready at your end, it’s time to look into data and validate the statements.
